## Obsidian guide
Obsidian is a complicated and in-depth note taking app, which might take a while to learn. Heres the basic things you need to know before beginning to take notes.

### Settings
Before you start taking notes, here are some required settings you must set up for everything to work properly. Here is a list of the required settings.

```
Template Folder: (2) Templates
Attachment Folder: (1) Assets
Spellcheck: On (Please..)
```

To set a folder as an attatchment folder, simply right click the folder and select the option “Set as attachment folder..”

To set a folder as a template folder, navigate to the template options screen (located on the bottom of settings bar), and set your folder of choice as the template folder.

To turn on spellcheck, simply go to the editor setting and turn it on.
