### REFiLL documentation
Obsidian is a complicated and in-depth note taking app, which might take a while to learn. Heres the basic things you need to know before beginning to take notes.

#### Settings
Before you start taking notes, here are some required settings you must set up for everything to work properly. Here is a list of the required settings.

```
Template Folder: Templates
Attachment Folder: Assets
Spellcheck: On 
```

To set a folder as an attatchment folder, simply right click the folder and select the option “Set as attachment folder..”

To set a folder as a template folder, navigate to the template options screen (located on the bottom of settings bar), and set your folder of choice as the template folder.

To turn on spellcheck, simply go to the editor setting and turn it on.

#### Plugins and themes
Plugins and themes are important parts of Obsidian, which allow you to add more onto your notetaking experience. REFiLL requires certain plugins in order to function correctly. You can turn on community plugins in Options > Community plugins > Turn off safe mode, and then going into “Browse community plugins..”.

##### Plugins list
-  Required plugins have an asterisk `*` at the end of them.
-  Reccommended plugins have a plus sign `+` at the end of them.
-  Situational/unknown plugins have a question mark `?` at the end of them.

#### File navigation
Each contributor has their own respective pool for in-progress projects. If a group project is started, it can be worked on either in the common pool or a projects pool (if wanted by contributors). Each pool is listed by name and icons can be accustomed by the author.

Each author folder can have any type of folder higharchy, but should be organized accordingly to the common pool. If there isn’t a category inside of the common pool that fits the project at hand, please contact a host for a new category.

Assets and templates can be used for extra help with notes, including templates, which can randomize banner images and allow preset metadata. For more information on templates, please see [here.](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Templates) 

Assets are for images and banners, feel free to add attachments for projects there.

##### Author pools
As mentioned previously, author pools are for personal projects regarding said author. Every contributor has 1 pool, which they can customize as much as they want. When projects are done, the contributor may move their project onto the common pool where it will be stored.

MOC’s and other sorting methods are allowed to be used, but shouldn’t interfere with the common pool’s sorting method. Plugins that are utilized inside of the author’s project folder should be listed, or suggested to the main plugins list.

For group projects, authors are allowed to copy a project into their own pool. Credits must be mentioned at either the beginning or end of the project, with the contributors that have worked on it.

#### Extra help and projects
For help with formatting your notes on Obsidian, please see the [official help page](https://help.obsidian.md/Start+here), or contact a host for formatting customs. You can also press F1 and open the test lab to try and test formatting as well.

##### Projects
When starting a group project, you may use either the common pool or a specialized folder in your author pool to work with other contributors on an essay or documentation. If a specialized folder is made, it can be moved to the common pool upon completion.

Projects can be categorized in tags, which can be labeled on metadata. When labeling tags in metadata, please capitalize the T in “tags”. For more information on metadata, see the advanced topics section in the [official help page](https://help.obsidian.md/Start+here).

#### Note formatting
Most notes must begin with metadata, which you can activate by putting three dashes `---` on top and on the bottom of the beginning text inside of a note/project. Templates can be used to automatically set up metadata as well, and there is one already included that you can use to start your project. If you do not want to use the template, you must include these tags in your metadata.

```
Tags: [ "#ipsum", "#lorem", "#dorem" ]
Aliases (links): [ "[[lorem]]", "[[ipsum]]" ]
Module: 'subjecthere'
Type: 'typeofprojecthere'
Date: 'currentdate'
banner: (banner here)
```

Also follow the formatting for tags and aliases when making metadata, as it won’t work if you format it any other way.

All notes must require a table of contents as well, which links headers and sections of your project for navigation purposes. you can link headers by linking the current project and adding a # to it, such as this: `[[Start Here (Instruction)#Settings]]`. To make the display name in order to make it look nicer, you can add a | and then with your display name. Linked headers normally look like this: [[Start Here (Instruction)#Settings]].

Other then these prerequisites for organization and navigation, you are allowed to format your projects in any way you’d like to.
