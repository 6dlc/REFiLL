# Plugins and themes
Plugins and themes are important parts of Obsidian, which allow you to add more onto your notetaking experience. REFiLL requires certain plugins in order to function correctly. You can turn on community plugins in Options > Community plugins > Turn off safe mode, and then going into “Browse community plugins..”.
