# REFiLL
REFiLL is a note-taking group that works on multitudes of projects from many contributors. Below is detailed instruction on how to contribute and participate in REFiLL.

### Prerequisites
- Latest version of Obsidian (https://obsidian.md/download)
- An already-made Obsidian vault named REFiLL
- Git/Github (https://git-scm.com/downloads), Github available on website
- A pre-existing Github account
- Discord (optional, but reccommended)

### Contribute instructions
1) Ensure that you have Obsidian and have an Obsidian vault before starting, also make sure that you have Git and GitHub installed.

2) Fork the repository by clicking the fork button in the top right.

3) Open up Git Bash and navigate to your Obsidian vault using the given command. You can find Git Bash by searching for it in your installed apps.

```
$ cd yourvaultfolder
$ cd youractualvaultfolder
```

(Only do second step if you put your vault in a dedicated folder.)

4) Copy the source link from your repository and clone it into your vault

```
$ git clone (source link)
```

5) Add a folder with your name as author, and then add your project(s) to them. You may use the given plugins, and your own customs as well.

6) When you’re done, put the notes in the common pool with your category of choice. If the note doesn’t have a category, contact 6dlc#5528 and request to make one.

7) When you finished, open the command palette and create a backup. After, push your changes to the repository. You can open the command pallete with CTRL+P, or the icon located when you turn on the setting. This requires you to be a contributor.

8) Congratulations! You've contributed! You may contribute again and update your branch. If any additions were made before you contribute, make sure to fetch them before requesting to add them to the main branch.
